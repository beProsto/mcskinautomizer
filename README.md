# Minecraft Skin Automizer
## A quick minecraft skin shaker
## Dresses up your skins in given suits whilst also giving you the freedom to poke holes in them for tails and other stuff

Usage:
1. Bring all your skin files to `in/skins/`
2. Bring all your suits files to `in/suits/`
3. Bring all your tails files to `in/tails/`

Remember! The name of the files in the tails folder must be the same as in the skins folder!

4. Run `autoskin.exe`
5. All your skins are now finished and in the `out/` directory
